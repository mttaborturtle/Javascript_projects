## Basic Elements
You will find a large repository for all of my experimental elements that I created.
Take a look around and check out the different code I created using CSS and JavaScript.

## Pizza Time
This project is a pizza ordering menu. You select the pizza size and toppings. 
It then tabulates your total. It also creates a 'reciept' on the console.

## Tic-Tac-Toe
My version of the classic game of tic-tac-toe. It randomly selects who goes first
and then the classic game starts. Select your boxes and hopefully win 3 in a row.
There will be some flashing lines and sounds for the winner and a special sound for a tie.

## Calculator
A basic calculator. Users can add, subtract, multiply, and divide on a neat and colored web version
of a calculator.
